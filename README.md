# Tank-V-Missile

A desktop browser game of shooting down missiles with a tank - built exclusively in HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript. 

## Instructions for Playing

For the game, go to: http://t-games-factor.herokuapp.com/ .

Click on the tank to shoot out a cannon/bullet in order to intercept the dropping missile mid-air so the missile does not reach the ground. 

Every time the missile reaches and bursts on the ground there is a loss of 5 points. Therefore, every time a missle is successfully intercepted and shot down with the cannon, you gain 5 points. There are 75 points attainable until the game stops. 

At the end of each cycle would be a message to either "Try Again" or "No Thanks!". Clicking on "Try Again" takes you back to the start of the game while clicking on "No Thanks!" takes you to, either your immediate past webpage in your "window.history" stack, or just a blank browser page, if this game's webpage is the only one currently in your "window.history" stack.

HAVE FUN PLAYING!
